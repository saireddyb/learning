gRPC is an open source framework that handles RPC remote procedure call and helps build scalable and fast APIs

It ensures maximum API security performance, and scalability

It allows the client and sever applications to communicate transparently



gRPC basic concepts

Protocol buffers 
Porotocol buffers or protobuf is used as Interface Definition Language and serialization toolset by gRPC

Streaming
The multiplexing capability that is sending multiple responses or receiving multiple requests 
together over a single TCP connection of HTTP/2 makes streaming possible 

HTTP/2 
Bidirectional streaming was possible full fledged. This kind of request/response multiplexing 
is made possible in HTTP/2 by introducing a new HTTP/2 layer called binary framing

Channels 
Channels support multiple streaming over multiple concurrent connections 

When to use gRPC
Real time communication services
For internal APIs 
Multiple language environments


Strengs of gRPC
performance
Streaming
security

Weakness of gRPC
Limited browser support 
Steeper learning curve
Non human readable format
No edge caching
