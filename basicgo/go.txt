1- Statically types language
2- Strongly types language

And collection of these package is known as module

When initializing a go project we are creating a module

go data types

const myConst
var myVar

bool
folat32 float64
int int16 int32 int64
rune
string
uint uint8 uint16 uint32

-----------

function 

func hello(a string) (int, int) {
  return 5, 5
}

-----------
struct and interfaces


type gasEngine struct{
  mpg uint8
  gallons uint8
}

myEngine1 := gasEngine{mpg:25, gallons:14}
var myEngine2 gasEngine = gasEngine{mpg:25, gallons:15}


methods 

func (e gasEngine) milesLeft() uint8 {
  return e.gallons*e.mpg
}
