Concurrency:
Imagine you're cooking in the kitchen. Concurrency is like chopping vegetables while your soup is simmering. You switch between tasks (chopping and stirring) to make progress on both, even though you're not doing them at the exact same moment.

Parallelism:
Now, picture having two chefs working side by side in the kitchen. Both are chopping, stirring, and doing different tasks simultaneously. That's parallelismâ€”doing multiple things at the same time.

go func() {

}

context switching
functions calls
garbage collections
network calls
channel operations

go routine are multiplexed to a fewer number of OS threads
context-switching time of go-routines in much faster
go routines communicates using channels
